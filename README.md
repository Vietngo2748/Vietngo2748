# Hi, I'm Viet Ngo 👋
Analog & Mixed-Signal IC Design | SerDes | High-Speed Interfaces

I am passionate about integrated circuit design, with a strong focus on analog and mixed-signal systems, including high-speed serial links, data converters, and power management circuits.
My work spans from architecture and circuit design to layout, verification, and system-level evaluation.

🔬 Research & Technical Interests

- High-speed SerDes & Receiver Equalization (CTLE, DFE, FFE)

- Current-steering DACs for wireline and transmitter applications

- Low-dropout (LDO) regulators and power management ICs

- Analog CMOS circuit design (op-amps, biasing, references)

- Signal integrity, PVT analysis, and layout-aware design
